# Prodigy InfoTech Machine Learning Internship Task 1

## **Task Details**

Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

## **Implementation**

There was two major steps to this process:

1. Cleaning and extracting the relevant data from the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). All the code related to this step is found in DataCleaning notebook.
2. Creating and fitting the linear regression model over our data and using it to perform predictions on new data. This can be found in the LinearRegression notebook.


### **Step 1 - DataCleaning.ipynb**

- Selected the relevant features needed in this task.
- Checked for null values and dealt with them appropriately (usually just dropped from the dataset)
- Plotted the features against my target and checked for outliers.
