---

### Task Details

Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

### Implementation

There was two major steps to this process:

1. Cleaning and extracting the relevant data from the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). All the code related to this step is found in DataCleaning notebook.
2. Creating and fitting the linear regression model over our data and using it to perform predictions on new data. This can be found in the LinearRegression notebook.
